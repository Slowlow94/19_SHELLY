#19_SHELLY

Minishell was by far the longest project to complete. It wasn't the most fun, but it did teach me several things, including how to code as part of a team, how to use git with more than one person, i.e. using branches rather than the master, how to adapt a previously completed project and reincorporate it into my code, and finally how to communicate well with my partner in order to be as efficient as possible.

Here's how we divided up the work: 
- parsing
- builtins
- execution
